category: "Events"
description: "Winter retreat is held during the first weekend of Winter quarter (Friday night - Sunday afternoon) where we get to spend time in solitude, MOI-ing with new people, and building up relationships with brothers and sisters through spending time with each other. Retreat is a time where we can get away from our distractions, whether it be friends, family, school, etc. and truly spend time with God."
